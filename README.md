Two types of Export/Import

-- Default Export/Import

    We can only do a single import from a file when we use default export.

     {export default <name of variable>}  at the end of the file.

     {import <vaiable name> from <file path>} in the beginning of file where it is to be imported.

-- Named Export/Import

We can do multiple imports from a single file.

export in front of the variable name.

import {<name of variable>} from <path of the file in which the variable is present>
